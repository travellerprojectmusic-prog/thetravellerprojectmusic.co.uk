The story is abstract, with carefully chosen lyrics, themes and experiences to take you on that journey as a listener. Unlike most modern music, it's been carefully curated for continuous listening to make it as immersive as possible. The EP will be fully released in February 2026.`

        The project focuses on emotional, abstract storytelling through music. Warm guitar tones and experimental electronica will take you on a journey through other worlds. The project explores a unique blend of genres to create a range of experiences, from intimate ambient soundscapes to anthemic rock. Inspirations include Gorillaz, Nick Drake, Tash Sultana, John Fruiscante and Massive Attack. Live shows range from acoustic sets to complex live looping setups.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the music is set in a fictional universe with unique lore, settings, characters and stories. Artwork is in development.

        I’m available for <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>songwriting</strong>.
</p>
<p>
For <strong>performance</strong> bookings, I can perform originals for up to hour-long sets, with covers for longer sets. Right now, performances would be acoustic sets or demo versions of my songs only. I am working on a studio-fidelity live set at the moment. Please contact me at the email below for bookings. Please note, I am unlikely to take singalong or feel-good-cover gigs as The Traveller Project.
	</p>
	<p>
I am open for <strong>songwriting</strong>. I have written songs for over 10 years and keep those skills sharp. I often write a new song every two weeks. Often, these songs don't fit into my artist persona, due to genre & tonal differences. 
</p>
<p>
I have written songs for others in fictional settings, and would like to do the same for musicians making their way in reality too.
</p>
<p>
If you like my focus on non-literal storytelling & lyricism, please contact me on the email below.

        <!-- Replace this with your About copy -->
       Hi, I'm Josh. Thank you for your curiosity.
</p>
<p>
I have played guitar and sang for 20 years. My first performance was on the mid-Suffolk grassroots folk circuit when I was 8 years old, where I sang an old gospel song. Since then I've loved and learnt different kinds of music, all of which is responsible for my music today.
      </p>
      <p>
       My vision is to build something beyond music with The Traveller Project. I can see a universe clearly in my minds eye, with distinct characters, stories and lore. Art, animation and creative writing will surround the music I create as The Traveller Project, deepening immersion and bringing my abstract world to life. 
	</p>
	<p>
Whilst the music is at the centre, the true experience of the project will be a unity of all the creative arts. My dream is that, one day, I'll create an immersive exhibition where The Traveller Project universe can be experienced in reality, so that everyone can delve into my world as deeply as possible, through the format which resonates with them the most - audio, visual, written. 
      </p>
	<p>
	As you can tell, I'm a dreamer. Right now, I'm at the start of my journey. I'd love if you would join me along the way.
